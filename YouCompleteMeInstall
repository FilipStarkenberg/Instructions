#Add to TOP of ~/vimrc: 

if has('vim_starting')
  set nocompatible               " Be iMproved
endif

filetype off                  " required

" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
" alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
"call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'

call vundle#end()            " required
filetype plugin indent on    " required

set shell=/bin/bash

let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = "~/.vim/.ycm_extra_conf.py"





Then do the following command: 
vim +PluginInstall +qall

Then do: 
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --clang-completer

Then create this file:
~/.vim/.ycm_extra_conf.py

And add the following to it (Not my config):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasendubi/dotfiles/master/.vim/.ycm_extra_conf.py

That's it! Try creating a .c file and start typing. Auto-complete will show up after 2 characters by default. 

You can test if it is working by doing :YcmDebugInfo inside vim. If text is displayed, somthing is working at least ;)
